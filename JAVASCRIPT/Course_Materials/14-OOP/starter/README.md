# OOP -- WHAT IS OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

**Def:** This is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects -- We use objects to _Model_ / _Describe_ real-world or abstract features;

**Point1:** Objects may contain data(properties and code (methods)). By using objects, we pack **_data and the correspond behavior_** into one block;

**Point2:** In OOP, objects are _Self-Contained_ pieces/blocks of code:

**Point3:** Objects are _building blocks_ of applications, and interact with one another

**Point4:** Interactions happen through a **Public Interface (API)** methods that the code **outside** of the object can access and use to communicate with the object
