# OOP -- WHAT IS OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

**Def:** This is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects -- We use objects to _Model_ / _Describe_ real-world or abstract features;

**Point-1:** Objects may contain data(properties and code (methods)). By using objects, we pack **_data and the correspond behavior_** into one block;

**Point-2:** In OOP, objects are _Self-Contained_ pieces/blocks of code:

**Point-3:** Objects are _building blocks_ of applications, and interact with one another

**Point-4:** Interactions happen through a **Public Interface (API)** methods that the code **outside** of the object can access and use to communicate with the object

#### Why does OOP exist ?

**Answer:** OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it **more flexible and easier to maintain** (avoid "spaghetti code");

# CLASSES & INSTANCES

**Class:** A blueprint from which we can create _new objects_ / not yet a real object to be used. However, it can be used to create multiple instances that are readily available to be used.

**Instance:** All objects created though a _class_ / a real object which can be used

### How do we model a real case into classes ?

This is not a single straightforward answer to this. However we thus have **4** Fundamental principles to guide us create good classes:

### Fundamental ==> 1: ABSTRACTION

**Abstraction:** Ignoring or hiding details that _don't matter_, allowing us to get an _overview_ perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation

### Fundamental ==> 2: ENCAPSULATION

**Encapsulation** Keeping properties and methods _private_ inside the class, so that they are **not accessible from outside the class**. SOme methods can be **exposed** as public interface (API).

### Fundamental ==> 3: INHERITANCE

### Fundamental ==> 4: POLYMORPHISM
