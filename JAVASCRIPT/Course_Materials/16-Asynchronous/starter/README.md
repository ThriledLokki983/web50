# SYNCHRONOUS Javascript
    
-  Code is run/executed line by line

- Each line waits for the previous line to finish 

- Long running operations block the code form executions


# ASYNCHRONOUS Javascript

- Code is executed after a task that runs in the 'background' finishes.
> e.g. setTimout(()=> {p.textContent = 'My name is asynchronous'}, 5000)
