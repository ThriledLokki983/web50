# MAPTY PROJECT

## Porject Planning

**User Stories:**

Description of the application's functionality form the user's _perspective_. All user stories put together describes the entire application. > High level overview of the applications.

> Common format: as a [type of user]-_who_, I want [an action]-_what_ so that [a benefit]-_why_.

> e.g: As a user, I want to **log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace steps/minute** so I can keep a log of all my running.

> e.g. As a user, I want to ** log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed, and elevation gain**, so I can keep a log of all my cycling

> e.g. As a user, I want to see all my workout at a glance so I can easily track my progress over time.

> e.g. As a user, I want to see all my workouts on a map, so I caneasily check where I wouk out the most

- **User stories helps to described what the application will do**.

**Features:**

> Map where user clicks to add new workout (best way to get a location coordinates)

> Geolocation to display map at current location (more user friendly)

> Form to input distance, time, pace, steps/minute.

> Form to input, time, speed, elevation gain

> Display all workouts in a list

> Display all workouts on the map

> Store workout data in the browser using local storage API

> On page load, read the saved data from local storage and display

**FlowChart:** _What we will build_

-

**Project Architecture:** how we will organize our code and implement the features described above. This is what holds all the codes together - _How we will build it_
its all about giveing you code a sructure -- e.g. OOP

**Development:** Implementation of our plan using _code_
