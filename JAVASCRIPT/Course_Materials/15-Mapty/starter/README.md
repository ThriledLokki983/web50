> e.g. As a user, I want to see all my workouts on a map, so I caneasily check where I wouk out the most

- **User stories helps to described what the application will do**.

**Features:**

**FlowChart:** _What we will build_

**Project Architecture:** how we will organize our code and implement the features described above. This is what holds all the codes together - _How we will build it_

**Development:** Implementation of our plan using _code_
