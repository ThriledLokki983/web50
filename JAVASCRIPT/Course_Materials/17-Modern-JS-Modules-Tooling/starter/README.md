# MODERN JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

    Modules - Building - Transpiling/Polyfiling - Javascript Bundle
                (BABEL - compiles our code to ES5 where all browsers can make use of - build tools - WebPack, Parcel);

    IMPORT (dependency) -- MODULE -- EXPORT (Public API)

**Modules:**

- Reusable piece of code that **encapsulates** implementation details _COmpose software_ Modules are small building blocks that we put together to build complex applications

  > **NPM:** Contains open-source packages to include 3rd-party code in our own code (e.g. React, JQuery, Leaflet)
